 * traversing the contact lists after the time step. However, you might miss
 * some contacts because continuous physics leads to sub-stepping.
 * Additionally you may receive multiple callbacks for the same contact in a

 * You should strive to make your callbacks efficient because there may be
 * many callbacks per time step.
